# Celeste-Video-Autosplitter
A video autosplitter for Celeste, great for people like me stuck on Microsoft Store version :(.

Still in progress, but going well, expect it to be moving along quickly. (Until I have to test it and lots of errors happen)

There will be a separate repo with instructions for cloning and adding your own stuff to make your own video autosplitter, as well as docs.

Also, check out [This Guide](https://gist.github.com/TheSoundDefense/cf85fd68ae582faa5f1cc95f18bba4ec) by [TheSoundDefense](https://gist.github.com/TheSoundDefense), probably would have been impossible to make this without it.
